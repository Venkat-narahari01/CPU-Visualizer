Graphical Process Scheduling and Memory Allocation Visualizer  
=============================================================  

**As a**  
Computer Engineering Student  

**I want**  
A software tool that graphically demonstrates process scheduling policies (such as FCFS)  
and memory allocation policies (such as First Fit).  

**So that**  
I can have a better understanding of these concepts.  

Acceptance Criteria  
-------------------  

**Process Scheduling Policies**  
    * FCFS (First Come, First Served)  
    * SPN (Shortest Process Next)  
    * SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)  
    * RR (Round Robin)  
    * HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next)  
    * MLQ (Multi-Level Queue)  


**Memory Allocation Policies**  
    * First Fit  
    * Next Fit  
    * Worst Fit  
    * Best Fit  


**Additional Features**  
    * Manually entering process data. 
    * Create random process
    * Configure context switch 
    * Set quantum for Round Robin (RR)
    * Assigning different color for each process
    * User guide
